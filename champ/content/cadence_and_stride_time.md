Cadence, Stride Time, and Contact Time: Plain‑English Guide
Key terms
Cadence: steps per minute (spm). Comfortable walking often ranges ~80–115 spm.

Stride time: time from one foot strike to the next strike of the same foot (often ~1.1–1.6 s at easy pace).

Contact time: time the foot stays on the ground each step (often ~0.35–0.55 s at easy pace).

Why they matter
Consistent cadence and stride time often correlate with smoother, rhythmic gait.

Longer contact time can reflect a cautious pace; not inherently “bad”—interpret in context.

How PhysioChamp uses them
Tracks per‑session values and last‑N trends.

Suggests simple cadence “steady‑pace” intervals to reinforce rhythm and symmetry.

Practice ideas
Keep steps even and relaxed; avoid rushing.

Try 2–3 sets of 2 minutes at a steady cadence with 1 minute easy between sets.
